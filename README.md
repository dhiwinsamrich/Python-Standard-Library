## üìÇ Projects

### 1. argparse
- **Description:** Argparse Module
- **Detailed Explanation:**

The `argparse` module in Python is used for parsing command-line arguments. It helps create user-friendly command-line interfaces by defining required arguments, providing help messages, and parsing user input.

**Key Features:**
- Define positional and optional arguments
- Automatically generate help messages
- Convert argument strings to the appropriate type
- Specify default values for arguments

### 2. Chat Application
- **Description:** Chat Application with Client and Server
- **Function:** This project includes two files: `Client` and `Server`. It demonstrates a basic chat application where multiple clients can connect to a server and exchange messages.

**Key Features:**
- **Server:** Listens for incoming connections and relays messages to all connected clients.
- **Client:** Connects to the server, sends messages, and receives messages from other clients.
- **Multithreading:** Ensures multiple clients can communicate simultaneously.

This chat application provides a basic framework for building real-time communication systems, leveraging Python's socket programming and multithreading capabilities.

### 3. Daemon Threads
- **Description:** Daemon Threads
- **Detailed Explanation:**

Daemon threads in Python are background threads that automatically terminate when all non-daemon threads have finished. They are useful for tasks that should not prevent the program from exiting.

**Key Features:**
- **Background Execution:** Daemon threads run in the background, allowing the main program to complete without waiting for the daemon threads to finish.
- **Automatic Termination:** Daemon threads are automatically killed when the program exits.

Daemon threads are ideal for tasks like monitoring, logging, or periodic updates that do not need to block the main program from exiting.

### 4. Deleting Emails
- **Description:** Deleting Emails
- **Function:** This project demonstrates how to delete emails from an email account programmatically using Python.

**Key Features:**
- **Email Access:** Connect to an email server using IMAP or POP protocols.
- **Email Deletion:** Identify and delete specific emails based on criteria like sender, subject, or date.
- **Security:** Ensure secure connection and authentication when accessing the email server.

This project provides a practical example of automating email management tasks, such as cleaning up old or unwanted emails from an inbox.

### 5. Download and Upload Files in FTP
- **Description:** FTP File Transfer
- **Function:** This project demonstrates how to download and upload files to an FTP server using Python's `ftplib` module.

**Key Features:**
- **FTP Connection:** Establishes a connection to the FTP server.
- **File Upload:** Uploads files from the local machine to the FTP server.
- **File Download:** Downloads files from the FTP server to the local machine.
- **Directory Navigation:** Navigates through directories on the FTP server.

This project is essential for automating file transfers and managing files on remote servers using the FTP protocol.

### 6. Extension Separator
- **Description:** Organize Files by Extension
- **Function:** This project sorts files in a directory into subdirectories based on their file extensions.

**Key Features:**
- Automatically creates subdirectories for each file type.
- Moves files into corresponding subdirectories.
- Helps maintain an organized file system.

The Extension Separator is a useful tool for organizing files, making it easier to manage and locate them based on their types.

### 7. Generating Random Data
- **Description:** Random Data Generator
- **Function:** This project generates random data for testing and development purposes.

**Key Features:**
- Generate random names, addresses, emails, and more.
- Supports customizable data formats.
- Useful for populating databases and testing applications.

Generating Random Data is essential for simulating real-world scenarios during software development and testing.

### 8. Handling Files
- **Description:** File Handling Utilities
- **Function:** This project demonstrates various file handling operations such as reading, writing, and manipulating files.

**Key Features:**
- Read from and write to text files.
- Handle binary files.
- Perform file operations like copy, move, delete, and rename.

Handling Files provides a comprehensive guide to managing files efficiently in Python, showcasing the versatility of the built-in file handling capabilities.

### 9. Hangman Game
- **Description:** Classic Hangman Game
- **Function:** This project implements the classic Hangman game where players guess letters to form a hidden word.

**Key Features:**
- Interactive command-line interface.
- Tracks incorrect guesses and displays a hangman figure.
- Provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses.

The Hangman Game is a fun and interactive project that demonstrates basic game development and user interaction in Python.

### 10. Listing Files in FTP Server
- **Description:** FTP Server File Listing
- **Function:** This project connects to an FTP server and lists all files in a specified directory.

**Key Features:**
- Connect to an FTP server using credentials.
- Navigate directories and list files.
- Useful for managing and auditing files on an FTP server.

Listing Files in FTP Server helps in accessing and managing files on remote FTP servers efficiently.

### 11. Logging
- **Description:** Logging Module
- **Function:** This project demonstrates the use of Python's built-in `logging` module for tracking events and debugging.

**Key Features:**
- Set up and configure loggers, handlers, and formatters.
- Log messages at different severity levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).
- Write log messages to files, console, or other outputs.

The Logging module is crucial for monitoring application behavior, diagnosing issues, and maintaining records of events in a systematic manner.

### 12. Regular Expressions
- **Description:** Working with Regular Expressions
- **Function:** This project demonstrates how to use Python's `re` module for searching, matching, and manipulating strings using regular expressions.

**Key Features:**
- Pattern matching
- Substring search and replace
- Validating string formats

Regular Expressions are powerful tools for text processing, allowing complex pattern matching and string manipulation tasks.

### 13. Split String
